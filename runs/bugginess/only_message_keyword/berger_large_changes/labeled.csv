	- DocPad will now warn you when you have files of the same outPath
	- File and Document IDs will now always be their `cid` (before they
use to be their relativePath on occasion)
	- Fuzzy searching no longer searches for the id
	- Server is now able to serve cached pages while a non-initial
generation is occurring
	- We no longer replace tabs with 4 spaces for the content of files and
documents (we still do it for YAML meta data headers on documents)
		- This means if you're a plugin developer, you may need to update
your plugin's test's `out-expected` folder accordingly
			- If this is too difficult, we've added a `removeWhitespace` config
option for your plugin tester, set it to `true`, [see here for
usage](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-paged/blob/master/src/pag

a higher order contraint `fixc` which takes a function which must take
3 arguments - the term, the substitution and a reifier. This function
must return a goal. This goal can of course call fixc again
recursively, perhaps using constrain-tree to get tree constraining
behavior. Redefine `treec` in terms of `fixc` as an example :)",CommitLabel.NonBugFix,0,0.29

004205015d5f4dcad9d095ed20251b1f96ae53af,"A little more of the new scanner code is in this commit.

Please test DVB scanning in Europe with this commit.

This removes depreciated parts of dvbsignalmonitor, as they
are no longer used in scanwizard. The code now uses the range
and value reporting signals, instead of the old non-range 
reporting signals.

This moves SIScan thread handling code from ScanWizardScanner to SIScan.
Removes the USING_DVB checks on SIScan code in ScanWizard[Scanner] since,
as of  the last scanning checkin, SIScan no longer depends on DVB stuff 
to compile. This also adds some of the pcHDTV v4l scanning code to 
scanwizard, basically everything that doesn't depend on a pcHDTV v4l
enabled SIScan.

Finally, this makes some changes to SIScan, but just header and define
stuff. Everything else depends on using the new FrequencyTable class in
frequencytables.h, but testing by John Pullan seems to indicate that
the new frequency tables are breaking DVB scanning in Europe. So I will
make a patch that just adds the FrequencyTable stuff for testing before
anything goes into svn.

Due to pushing the scroll view down to a subview I needed to update
the way we calculate centering the photo. This needed to be done
when the scrollview's layoutSubviews method was called so I created
a simple subclass of UIScrollView that handles this. The rest of
the photo scroll view functionality was able to stay in the root
of the view.

it was simply setting the frame of all of the subviews, without giving
